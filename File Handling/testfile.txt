We have so far created programs in Python that
accept the input, manipulate it and display the
output. But that output is available only during
execution of the program and input is to be
entered through the keyboard. This is because the
variables used in a program have a lifetime that
lasts till the time the program is under execution.
What if we want to store the data that were input
as well as the generated output permanently so
that we can reuse it later? Usually, organisations
would want to permanently store information
about employees, inventory, sales, etc. to avoid
repetitive tasks of entering the same data. Hence,
data are stored permanently on secondary storage
devices for reusability. We store Python programs
written in script mode with a .py extension. Each
program is stored on the secondary device as a
file. Likewise, the data entered, and the output
can be stored permanently into a file.This line has been appended
